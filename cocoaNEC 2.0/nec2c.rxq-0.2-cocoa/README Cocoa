README File for nec2c-cocoa
Kok Chen, W7AY

cocoaNEC generates two copies of nec2c, one for double precision and one for quad precision.

This is done by placing the original code in nec2common.m.  Original variable types in nec2c.c are replaced by abstract types doubletype and complextype in nec2common.m.

nec2cquad.m first typedef doubletype as "long double" and complextype as "long double complex" before including the
nec2common.m, to create a quad precision version of nec2c.

The entry point for the double precision nec2c is necDouble(...) instead of main().

nec2cdouble.m first typedef doubletype as "double" and complextype as "double complex" before including the
nec2common.m, to create a quad precision version of nec2c.

The entry point for the double precision nec2c is necQuad(...) instead of main().

--------------

Note that nec2common.m is otherwise not directly included in the build target of cocoaNEC.

If only double floats is needed, simply include nec2cdouble.m and nec2common.m in the project (but leave nec2common.m out of the build target of the project).
